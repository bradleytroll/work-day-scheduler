# Work Day Scheduler README

## Overview
The **Work Day Scheduler** is a simple calendar app designed to help users schedule their workday effectively. It provides a clean interface with time blocks for each hour from 9 AM to 5 PM, allowing users to add and save tasks or notes for specific hours.

## Features
- **Current Date Display:** The app displays the current date at the top.
- **Time Blocks:** Time blocks for each hour from 9 AM to 5 PM are dynamically generated.
- **Dynamic Styling:** The time blocks are color-coded to indicate whether each hour is in the past, present, or future.
- **Local Storage:** Saved events persist in local storage, allowing users to retrieve their schedule even after refreshing the page.
